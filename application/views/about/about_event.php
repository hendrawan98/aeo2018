      <p class="text-justify font-h6">
        English Olympics is one of BNEC's most prestigious events. We have been conducting this event since 2004, 
        starting with the Nationwide English Olympics for 6 years. It then developed into 1 year of Southeast Asian 
        English Olympics, and lastly 5 years of Asian English Olympics with more than 500 participants from Indonesia, 
        Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Hong Kong, Macao, India, Bangladesh, Laos, and South Korea.

        Asian English Olympics (AEO) has come to its sixth year after being first held in 2012, hosted by BINUS University 
        and organized by BNEC. For the past years, AEO has been successfully improving its participants’ English skills, 
        giving meaningful experiences to be remembered in their youth, and broadening the networking of the participants across Asia.

      <p class="text-justify font-h6">
        The 2017 AEO will be held on February 9-13, 2017. This year, the Olympics will be completely fun and exciting to challenge 
        its participants in Debate, Speech, Spelling Bee, Short Story Writing, Newscasting, Scrabble, and Storytelling; along with a 
        newly established field, namely Radio Drama. As the Olympics, there will be an “Institutional Champion” title for participating 
        institutions. Every delegate who wins in each field of AEO will accumulate points for their institution to be crowned the title.

      <h4 class="top40 font-red top20"><b>Theme: "Live Your Aspiration"</b></h4>
  <p class="text-justify font-h6">
    "Live Your Aspiration” is about embracing competition and achievement. Everyone eventually faces competition in their lives. To keep up with this reality, practice and preparation are essential. The prestigious Asian English Olympics, hosted by BINUS University and organized by BINUS English Club, is an ideal opportunity for Asian youths to flex their competitive muscle. Not only will skills be challenged and tested against others, learning and growth are also part of the Olympics itself.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify font-h6">
    Through the theme this year, the message that’s hoped to be conveyed is for the Asian youths to be driven and more motivated for the high willingness to aspire. To know, follow, and live their aspiration.
